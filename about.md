## About Me

Welcome to my site! It's still under construction, but feel free to browse around. 

### What's your logo?
The logo at the top of this page is a stylized version of the [Eightfold Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eightfold_Way_(physics)), which was one of the clues that protons and neutrons are composite particles, made of smaller particles that we call quarks. The Python code to generate the image is available [here](https://github.com/christian-johnson/christian-johnson.github.io/blob/master/logo.py) if you'd like to make something similar.

### About this site
This site is hosted by GitHub Pages, and built using Jekyll. The Jekyll template I used is available on [Github](https://github.com/KingFelix/emerald/archive/master.zip).
